# Spring Modulith Playground

This is a playground project based on the [Spring Modulith](https://docs.spring.io/spring-modulith/docs/0.4.0/reference/html/) project.

The project leverages the approach outlined in the **JChampions Conference** demonstration, [Spring Modulith - Spring for the Architecturally Curious Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWCuFPT0640), and follows the rough structure that can be found in the presenter's demo repo [here](https://github.com/odrotbohm/arch-evident-spring).

## Database
The Database is configured to use PostgreSQL from a local Docker container. You can start the container by running `docker-compose up -d` inside the project's root directory. A simple PostreSQL database and associated PG-ADMIN pod will be created for you.
